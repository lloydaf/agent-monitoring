# agent-monitoring
==================
This is a web-based agent monitoring platform. It was designed to serve as a platform for b2b clients to monitor their salespeople, who visit agents to conduct sales. There are options to schedule visits, add feedback for visits, etc. 

What this is:
=============

Essentially, this is just a web-application that allows managers to monitor sales performance of their staff. A user who registers needs approval from the administrator before his/her account is activated. After logging in, you can add agents to your profile, add or schedule visits with the agents, and record feedback.

The administrator can view visits of every user and hence monitor their performance based on visits and feedback.

How to use this:
================

I ran this on an Apache Server, and you can just host this in your system or on a server. As the code is mainly LAMP Stack, a lot of fiddling is not needed to set this up.

Import the mysql database files, and navigate to the root folder, and you should see this start up.
